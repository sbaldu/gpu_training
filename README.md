### Hands-on

The CUDA Runtime API reference manual is a very useful source of information:
<a href="http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html" target="_blank">http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html</a>


Check that your environment is correctly configured to compile CUDA code by running:
```bash
$ nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2025 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Tue_May_27_02:21:03_PDT_2025
Cuda compilation tools, release 12.9, V12.9.86
Build cuda_12.9.r12.9/compiler.36037853_0
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/felicepantaleo/gpu_training.git
```

Compile and run the `deviceQuery` application:
```bash
$ cd hands-on/utils/deviceQuery
$ make
```

You can get some useful information about the features and the limits that you will find on the device you will be running your code on. For example:

```shell
$ ./deviceQuery
./deviceQuery Starting...

Some of you are sharing the same machine and some time measurements can be influenced by other users running at the very same moment. It can be necessary to run time measurements multiple times.


# GPU Training — Hands‑On Exercises

These short, self‑contained labs walk students from CUDA basics to a tiny predator–prey simulation.  Every exercise follows the same workflow:

```
1. Fill in all  ►►► TODO ◄◄◄  and/or kernel bodies.
2. Build with the line shown in the banner comment.
3. Run → the program prints “…PASSED 🎉” when assertions succeed.
```

All code lives under `gpu_training/` and compiles on CUDA 12 + gcc 13 (Ubuntu 22.04).

---

## Exercise 1 – CUDA Memory Model

*Goal – feel the separation between CPU (host) and GPU (device) address spaces.*

| Step | What you implement                                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | `cudaMallocAsync` two device buffers `d_a` and `d_b` |
|  2   | Copy host array `h_a → d_a`                          |
|  3   | Copy device array `d_a → d_b` (device‑to‑device)     |
|  4   | Copy back `d_b → h_a`                                |
|  5   | Free `d_a`, `d_b` with `cudaFreeAsync`               |

```bash
nvcc -std=c++20 memory_model.cu -o ex01
./ex01   # prints “Exercise 1 – memory model: PASSED 🎉”
```

### Variation

Add a non‑blocking version using **streams** + `cudaMemcpyAsync` and time a 100 MB H↔D copy to estimate PCIe bandwidth.

---

## Exercise 2 – Launch Your First Kernel

*Goal – understand grid/block configuration and indexing.*

1. `cudaMallocAsync` a device array `d_a[N]`
2. Launch a **1‑D grid** of **1‑D blocks**

   ```c++
   d_a[i] = i + 42;  // each thread writes one element
   ```
3. Copy back, verify, free the memory.

Compile & run:

```bash
nvcc -std=c++20 launch_kernel.cu -o ex02 && ./ex02
```

**Hint:** Global thread index = `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x`.

---

## Exercise 3 – 2‑D Grid & Block

*Goal – move from 1‑D to 2‑D indexing.*

Matrix **M\[numRows × numCols]**.

| Task | Detail                                                                                          |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Set `numRows`, `numCols` (start with 4 × 4, then 19 × 67).                                      |
| 2    | Launch a **2‑D grid of 2‑D blocks** so each thread writes<br>`M[row,col] = row * numCols + col` |
| 3    | Copy to host, assert correctness                                                                |
| 4    | Experiment: fix block = `16×16`, compute `blocksPerGrid` with ceiling division                  |

Compile:

```bash
nvcc -std=c++20 ex03_fill_matrix.cu -o ex03 && ./ex03
```

---

## Exercise 4 – Parallel Reduction ∑

*Goal – sum a 1‑D array faster than the CPU.*

> **Rule of thumb:** keep each block power‑of‑two and reduce in shared memory.

1. Kernel #1: each block loads its slice, does **shared‑mem tree reduction**, writes one partial sum.
2. Kernel #2: single block reduces those partials into the final total.
3. Copy result, compare to `std::accumulate`.

*Bonus*: one‑step reduction (single kernel).

---

## Parallel Challenge – **The Circle of Life**

A toroidal predator–prey world.  Build the starter **CPU version** first, then port to CUDA

Reference CPU build:

```bash
make serial
./circle_of_life --width 256 --height 256 --seed 42
```

Can you use the asynchronous GPU kernel launch to execute the generation of a git frame on the CPU while the GPU is running the next iteration?

### Common Pitfalls & Tips

* **Always** `cudaGetLastError()` after a launch when debugging.
* Use **asserts** on the host to check results before optimising.
* Remember `cudaStreamSynchronize()` before timing or freeing async memory.
* `dim3` defaults `z=1`; you almost never need a non‑unit Z for these labs.
* For reductions, `blockDim.x` **must** be a power‑of‑two when you half the stride each step.

## Thrust

The four labs below mirror the CUDA ones but use the Thrust C++ library. All code lives in hands-on/thrust/XX_<name>/.
Every exercise follows the same workflow:

1. Open the `.cu` file and replace each ►►► TODO ◄◄◄.
2. Build with the provided Makefile:   `$ make`       # or  make test  when shown
3. Run → the program prints “…PASSED 🎉” (or an assert succeeds).

    Build environment
    CUDA 12.9 · gcc 13 · Ubuntu 22.04.
    Thrust ships inside the CUDA toolkit—no extra install needed.

### Exercise 1 – Memory Model with Thrust Vectors

*Folder*: thrust/01_memory_model
*Goal*: practice host ↔ device copies and Thrust containers.
Step	What you implement

1	Initialize a `thrust::host_vector<int> h_buf(dim)` with 0, 1, 2, … (hint : `thrust::sequence`)
2	Create two `thrust::device_vector<int>` buffers `d1`, `d2`.
3	Copy host → d1 with any Thrust copy method.
4	Copy d1 → d2 using a different method (e.g. explicit iterator pair).
5	Zero h_buf on the CPU.
6	Copy d2 → h_buf and assert that values are again 0…dim-1.

Build & run:
```
cd hands-on/thrust/01_memory_model
make         # builds memory_model
./memory_model
```
Variation: time the H↔D copy using cudaEvent_t and compare to the raw‐pointer CUDA version.
### Exercise 2 – Your First Thrust “Kernel”

*Folder* : thrust/02_my_first_kernel

*Goal* : launch-free vector operations and async transfers.

    Pinned-host buffer h_a (use thrust::universal_vector or cudaMallocHost).

    Device buffer d_a (thrust::device_vector<int>(N)).

    Fill d_a with i + 42 using thrust::sequence.

    Create a cudaStream_t queue.

    Asynchronously copy d_a → h_a with thrust::copy(thrust::cuda::par.on(queue), …).

    Verify with an assert that h_a == {42, 43, …}.

Build:
```
cd hands-on/thrust/02_my_first_kernel
make
```
Run prints Correct, good work!.

Tip: wrap the Thrust copy in CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamSynchronize(queue)); before destroying the stream to avoid race conditions.
### Exercise 3 – Data Statistics (Mean & Stdev)

*Folder *: thrust/03_data_statistics
*Goal *: combine transform and reduce to compute simple stats.

1.	Host vector `h_data(N)`; fill with random floats (provided helper).
2.	Copy to `thrust::device_vector<float> d_data`.
3.	`Mean = thrust::reduce(d_data.begin(), d_data.end()) / N`.
4.	`squared_diffs[i] = (d_data[i] – mean)²` via `thrust::transform` with a lambda or functor.
5.	`Stdev = sqrt(reduce(squared_diffs)/N)`.
6.	Challenge: recompute stdev without the intermediate buffer (use a binary transform-reduce).

Build & run:
```
cd hands-on/thrust/03_data_statistics
make test      # Makefile prints mean & σ and checks against CPU reference
```
Hints

```
    thrust::placeholders::_1 can shorten lambdas (_1 - mean).
```

    For the "no buffer" variant use `thrust::transform_reduce`.

### Exercise 4 – Maximum Absolute Difference (Zip Iterators)

*Folder*: thrust/04_max_difference
*Goal*: learn zip iterators and element-wise transforms.

Two small host vectors `h_v1`, `h_v2` already provided.

Copy to `d_v1`, `d_v2`.

Use `thrust::transform` with a zip iterator pair to compute
`|v1-v2|` into a temporary `device_vector<int>` diffs.

```
    auto first = thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(d_v1.begin(),
                                                              d_v2.begin()));
    auto last  = first + d_v1.size();
    thrust::transform(first, last, diffs.begin(),
                      [] __device__ (auto t) {
                        int a = thrust::get<0>(t);
                        int b = thrust::get<1>(t);
                        return abs(a - b);
                      });

    max_difference = thrust::reduce(diffs.begin(), diffs.end(), 0, thrust::maximum<int>());
```

    Print the result and compare to a CPU calculation.

Build:
```
cd hands-on/thrust/04_max_difference
make
```

### Common Pitfalls & Tips

    Prefer algorithms (transform, reduce) over raw loops—Thrust chooses good launches for you.

    Explicit streams: .on(my_stream) works with every algorithm.

    device_vector reallocation is costly—reserve capacity if you grow it.

    Thrust follows C++20 ranges concepts; use std::views on the host for quick sanity checks.
